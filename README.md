# Hello Arduino

Use the monitor to print "hello world".

## Code 
[Hello World](https://create.arduino.cc/editor/wbarnett/49148fc3-9480-4dba-9c02-c4ca2001703a/preview)

## Refletion
Good start to coding. Had some trouble remembering the semi-colon at the end of lines.



# Finite LED blinker

Have a count-down clock that blinks the LED.

## Refletion
The variables gave me some issues but all around it went well.



# Variable LED blinker

Have a LED blink for a peroid then not blink for the same time.

## Refletion
The order of opertions made it harder to understand. All the spelling mistakes made it much harder.
